# Postsaccadic Oscillations

This repository contains R code developed in the context of the book chapter "Definition, modeling and detection of saccades in the face of post-saccadic oscillations", by Richard Schweitzer and Martin Rolfs. 

At this point it contains:
- Implementations of models to fit saccades with post-saccadic oscillations, as proposed by Bouzat et al. (2018) and Del Punta et al. (2019). 
- The "saccade simulator".
- Direction- and velocity-based PSO detection add-on for the Engbert-Kliegl algorithm for microsaccade detection. 

To see how the functions work, see the Rmarkdown file [ModelingDetectionOfPSOs.md](../blob/main/ModelingDetectionOfPSOs.md).
