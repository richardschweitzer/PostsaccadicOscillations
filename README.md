# PostsaccadicOscillations

This repository should at some point include:
- Implementations of models to fit saccades with post-saccadic oscillations, as proposed by Bouzat et al. (2018) and Del Punta et al. (2019). 
- The "saccade simulator"
- Direction- and velocity-based PSO detection add-on for the Engbert-Kliegl algorithm for microsaccade detection
